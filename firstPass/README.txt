Understand the dataset:

We use to have a gene set of 282 genes. They were identified in the mouse embryonic fibroblast using the technique of Chip-Seq (Malhotra D, Portales-Casamar E, Singh A, Srivastava S, Arenillas D, Happel C, Shyr C, Wakabayashi N, Kensler TW, Wasserman WW, Biswal S. Global mapping of binding sites for Nrf2 identifies novel targets in cell survival response through ChIP-Seq profiling and network analysis. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010;38(17):5718-34.)

Now, we have stopped this gene set and others. Instead, let's use "human NRF2-high ESCC gene set" and "mouse esophagus NRF2 ChIPseq gene set" (see attached) from now on located at ../doc/

I have corned a new name for each:

hsNRF2highESCC: human NRF2-high ESCC gene set
mmNRF2ChIPseqES: mouse esophagus NRF2 ChIPseq gene set
